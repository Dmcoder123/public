NO!

- acquisitions can ALWAYS change the stocks, they just have to keep retrying if the value has changed
  (optimistic concurrency here - do a where with the old quantity and keep retrying, for each record)
- sales should first lock the stocks and check that the quantity is enough
  if it is, go ahead and make the changes and release
  if not, a message should be returned to the customer indicating which stocks are not enough


sales:
  - lock the records at the beginning and only unlock them at the end
  - change the stock
  - fail if there's not enough stock
