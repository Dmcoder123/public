Video File 1,"This is a windows 7 application that will create a unique and randomized video out of images. The software will also use "text to voice" application to add audio to the video. The objective is to create unique videos with the same source content."
Video File 2,To create the actual video itself. the images will be randomized. and will each appear for random durations between 5 - 15 seconds. But they must NOT be still images. There must always be movement. The videos must use as many different effects as possible so that youtube will not consider them the same images just mixed around with effects. This is the main core of the application. and we need more than just simple transitions between images like a slideshow.
Video File 3, The idea is to create a video that partially resembles the original image. but will be different enough so that youtube considers it a unique video at any point in the video. So if we had 5 source images. we could create 20 x 60 second videos and they'll all be very different.
