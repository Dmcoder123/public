Original job description:

I need to get a console app made that we can pass a huge array of things to and it will output QR codes.
I need the console to be smart, if we just look to make 1 qr then it will be the image, if we pass it several then it will make a zip file of them.

I know for QR codes there are several things to control, like error correction, size etc.. so when you come up with the controls just let us know
how to set them for each job, ideally its in the data we pass to this app.

I would like to use this library on a server and will need to be able to have several instances of it running concurrently on different tasks.

Here is what i think we need at a high level

QR data to encode, size in px, name of file.png, error correction value, background color, foreground color.

I think there are some padding settings in QR but i dont know if we need anything non standard here. ill leave it to you.

I will need this thing to process thousands of rows in a single job so i need it to be threaded and fast. Ideally we can set some setting for max cpu threads to use (2-8 etc..)

for the zip file I want it created using http://dotnetzip.codeplex.com/
