* BinarySearchTimings: comparing different search algorithms; see article at http://mdpopescu.blogspot.com/2013/05/optimization-implementing-binary-search.html
* CompareExcelFiles: compares two Excel files with the same structure, based on the indicated columns; shows for each file what records are present in that one but not the other
* CompareExcelFiles2: the same project as above but started from scratch using TDD; article at http://mdpopescu.blogspot.com/2013/06/comparing-excel-files-take-two.html
* Failover: fail-over algorithm; see article at http://mdpopescu.blogspot.com/2013/06/fail-over-algorithm.html
* Hot Folder Windows Service: Windows service to monitor a specific folder and (for now) log the create / delete / change / rename events
* Inventory: (INCOMPLETE) inventory management system - mainly to use SignalR and Knockout.js
* RecursiveCompare: recursive comparison of two objects' properties (if some of those properties are objects, compare those using the same algorithm); incomplete
* SafeRedir: time-limited URL redirection; the shortened link will redirect to the real one for only a limited time (default 5 minutes) and then redirect to a "safe" link afterwards; deployed at http://red.renfieldsoftware.com/
* YelpSearch: search Yelp for businesses (eg hotels) near a given zip; solution for https://www.odesk.com/jobs/~~d5624935369d26d1 (I didn't get the job so the code is mine)
* QRMaker: the same guy with the Yelp project had another one, a bulk QR generator; unfortunately I didn't get this job either - https://www.odesk.com/jobs/URGENT-Really-fast-Bulk-maker-zip_~01368c1f8e16aa230d
* PageFaults: project from https://www.freelancer.com/projects/C-Sharp-Programming/FIFO-OPTIMAL-LRU.html (I included the detailed spec in the project); apparently someone else is taking the same exam - https://www.freelancer.com/projects/C-Sharp-Programming/lab-rep-project-repost.4718106.html
